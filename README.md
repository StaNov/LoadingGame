# LoadingGame
Game called "Loading..." made with Unity

## Why am I doing this?

I want to be an indie game developer. So this is my first real try to make a non-LudumDare game.

* Taste the feel of how it is like to be an indie.
* Get some experience in Unity and developing for Android.
* Try Reddit communication.
* Get feedback for my work.
